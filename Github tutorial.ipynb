    "A version control systems is a system of managing multiple versions of some piece of information - e.g. code or document files. It is useful when working in a team or simply when editing one's own code (to keep a track of changes made and go back to previous version if the new changes don't work). Version control system saves the screenshots of files (shown in Figure below as v1, v2..) and we can go back the last saved files we want to go to. It uses an efficient algorithm to store information in these screenshots. The link indicates how they are connected (backward arrow as we can always move back in the code history). The main branch (which we tart when we first create the repository) is called master branch. \n",

    "All the team members can get a copy of the repository and they can have the files in their local computer and work on it using in their own computer. Later they can push it to the main repository (central repository).\n",

Because of decentralization, it super-fast. Git is most common version control system. All the files are stored in repository. It is a good practice to keep separate repository for different applications (make it modular styled). For example, building an application for an app, keep a separate repository for chat section and a separate one for the image section. Git repository consists of all the files along with the history of the file. "
